		     Dodge Car Game Rules

One Player Mode: The goal is to score as much as possible. To do so, you have to avoid the 
enemy cars and make your way as far as possible. Move your car using left 
and right arrow keys. 

Two Player Mode: The goal is to make your opponent hit any of the enemy cars. So dodge 
your opponent player towards the enemy car. But remember, you cannot 
dodge more than once at a time. Once you have dodged your opponent, your 
power will go down. Unless the power meter fills up, you cannot dodge 
again! But if you do so, then nothing will happen.
