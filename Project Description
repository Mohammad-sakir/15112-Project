Project Title: Dodge Cars

This is a dodge car game. 
The game can be played in 2 different modes. 
Single player and double player. 
Before the game starts, there will be instructions to play it. 
In single player mode, the car has to overcome all the obstacles in roads and reach the endpoint. 
In every level, number of obstacles and speed of the car will keep increasing. 
In the double player mode, the goal of each player will be to dodge the other car and make it hit any obstacle. 
But one car cannot keep hitting the other car continuously. 
So there will be a power bar for each car. 
Once it dodges the other car, the power will decrease. 
Then the power will increase slowly and gradually. 
So once the power is fully empty, that car cannot hit the other car unless the power restores to a minimum extent. 
And this will keep going unless one car hits any obstacle. 
Also, if the distance between the cars increases too much, there will be an indicator that how far the other car is.

I am planning to use 'pygame' and 'random' library for this project.

By the first checkpoint, I hope the single player mode will be ready to be displayed at least first level.

By the second checkpoint, I am hoping to present single player mode completely with all the levels.

My final project hopefully will contain all the features as mentioned earlier.
